### Oh boy! My favorite video creator ChubbyEmu just posted a new video! Too bad I don't have the time to watch it! :(

TLDW (Too Long, Didn't Watch) is a super simple flask application that lets you upload the URL of a video, and in return, recieve a summary of it!

##Installing TLDW
Just download the code from the github repo and after setting up the venv, install gemini api with the following command:
`pip install -q -U google-generativeai`
I already have my genai apikey in there, just use it if you want, idrc

##Use
Just run the file! The app should be hosted at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
